- 👋 Hi, I’m @NyuWay, a french student working on coding/developpement.
- 💞️ I fell in love with JAVA, JAVASCRIPT, CSHARP (useful with the unity engin) and the worst : SKRIPT (for minecraft servers)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning these awsome languages.
- 👀 I’m just looking for fun while coding.
- 📫 Discord: Nyu!#0497

- I am interested about the Java Discord API to develope some bots for friends (https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)
